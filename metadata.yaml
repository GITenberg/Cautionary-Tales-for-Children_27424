description: 'From the Publisher: One of Hilaire Belloc''s most famous works, "Cautionary
  Tales for Children" satirizes a genre of admonitory children''s literature popular
  in England in the late 18th and 19th centuries.  The seven stories contained in
  this work are macabre parodies of childhood lessons, and will entertain more sophisticated
  readers who can appreciate these tales of disproportionate punishment.  Presented
  in a classic picture book style, illustrators have captured the foibles of children
  like Jim, who let go of his nurse''s hand and was eaten by a lion; Matilda, who
  told lies, and was burned to death; and Henry King who swallowed string.  The consequences
  range from naughty children being whimsically eaten by lions, to stern reprimands
  for a boy who fires a loaded gun at his sister.  Originally written nearly a century
  ago, Belloc''s sprightly verses are a quick and cathartic read for teenagers, and
  reflect a trend of literature that is still popular today.'
